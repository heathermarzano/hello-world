Ideas and resources

Hi People,

I'm Heather. I taught myself HTML in high school and eventually turned Web Development into a career. My favorite languages are HTML and CSS. Bootstrap is usually my go-to framework when I want to make a website responsive. I also have experience working with WordPress: making a custom child theme and using a bit of PHP to create custom templates and functions.

Hoping to learn more skills and become a stronger developer!

Ok, goodbye.
